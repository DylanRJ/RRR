            <div><h1><u>Regal Roots Revision</u> <br> Dylan James</h1>
            <p>Hello from me, the creator of RRR. Thank you for taking the time to visit this website, I sincerely hope that your visit has been both an enjoyable and educational experience.</p>

        <div id="contactreasons">
            <p>This website was created for 5 main reasons.</p><br>
            <p><u>Click Here to display reason list.</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a>Firstly, Regal Roots Revision was born out of a love and passion for Jamaican and wider Carribean roots music in the last century</a></li>
                <li><a>Secondly, this website is a response to the general ubiquity of roots music and artists in popular culture without a real understanding of the origin of the music or peoples behind their creation.</a></li>
                <li><a>Thirdly, the influence which roots music has had on mainstream artists has never been fully realised and even when elements of their music have been inclued they have scarcely been credited.</a></li>
                <li><a>Fourthly, having looked online, there was a severe lack of websites centered on the educational side of the music and culture. Whilst a few concentrated heavily on promoting current artists, none had any reference to former artists or any sort of interactivity for the user.</a></li>
                <li><a>Lastly, I found it surprising that whilst the artists in roots music often originate from underpriviledged backgrounds. There if little effort by supporters or artists themselves to promote initiatives which would help younger generations.</a></li>
            </ul>
